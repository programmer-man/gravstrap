# Configuration

## Common SEO

For SEO, you have the following default configuration:
```
seo:
  robots: without
  length: 20
  taxonomy:
    enabled: true
  page_content:
    enabled: false
```

`robots` or "Default Robots Meta-Tag" allow you to define default rules for bots. You have the following possibilities:
- noindex: prevents the page from being indexed
- nofollow: don't follow links from this page when looking for new pages to crawl
- nosnippet: don't show a snippet of this page when displaying it in the search results
- noodp: don't use text from ODP (The Open Directory Project a.k.a. dmoz.org) to generate a title or snippet for this page
- noarchive: don't display a "Cached" link for this page in the search results

`length` or "Number of keywords" allow you to define maximum number of keywords to display in meta-tag.

`taxonomy.enabled` or "Use Taxonomy Keywords" allow you to use Keywords of Taxonomy for Meta-Tags.

`page_content.enabled` or "Use Page Content Keywords" allow you to use Keywords of page content (`<strong>` and `<em>`) for Meta-Tags.

## Associate Twitter account


For Twitter, you have the following default configuration:
```
social_pages:
  pages:
    twitter:
      enabled: true
      type: summary
      username: ''
```

`enabled` or "Twitter Cards active" enable integration of [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) meta-tags.

`type` or "Card Type" define the typÃª of card used by meta-tag. Accepted values are: `summary`, `summary_large_image`.

`username` or "Twitter Username" is your twitter account reachable by https://twitter/username.

## Associate Facebook App Id

### Namespace configuration

Facebook uses [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me/) metatags that requires to use a namespace on `html` tag.

In your base template, add the following line in the `html` tag:

```twig
<html {{
  (config.plugins['social-seo-metatags'].enabled and config.plugins['social-seo-metatags'].social_pages.pages.facebook.enabled) ? 'xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#"' : ''
}}>
```

### Plugin configuration

For Facebook, you have the following default configuration:
```
social_pages:
  pages:
    facebook:
      enabled: false
      appid: '1234567890'
```

`enabled` or "Facebook active" enable integration of [Facebook Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/getting-started) meta-tags.

You need to generate an app_id. Without this property you will lose admin right on the Open Graph Facebook Page.

### Gzip activation

It could be that content sharing on facebook require the _Gzip activation_. The [Facebook debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/) will display no data or incomprehensible errors in this case.

To resolve it, set the `cache.gzip` to `true` in `system.yaml` configuration file.

This behavior is discussed [here](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues/1955).
